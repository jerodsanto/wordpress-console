An interactive console for WordPress developers

== Description ==

One killer feature of [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) is the Rails Console.  It allows developers to examine and modify their code and data interactively from within the Rails environment. This plugin's aim is to provide a similar environment for WordPress plugin developers.

Once activated, the plugin adds a "Console" page to the administrator's "Tools" menu. This page includes a JavaScript-based interactive shell which loads the WordPress environment. It allows execution of arbitrary PHP code as well as anything defined by WordPress or activated plugins. This is awesome.

== Installation ==

1.  Upload wordpress-console/ directory to the wp-content/plugins directory.
