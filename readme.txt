An interactive console for WordPress developers

== Description ==

This plugin adds a "Console" page to the administrator's menu which provides a JavaScript-based interactive console that loads the WordPress environment. It allows execution of arbitrary PHP code as well as anything defined by WordPress or activated plugins. This is awesome for plugin developers and people learning PHP and/or the WordPress API.
